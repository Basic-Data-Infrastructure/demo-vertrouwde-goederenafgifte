;;
;;
;;  "Signed JWTs MUST use and specify the RS256 algorithm in the
;;   alg header parameter.
;;
;;   Signed JWTs MUST contain an array of the complete certificate
;;   chain that should be used for validating the JWTâ€™s signature in
;;   the x5c header parameter up until an Issuing CA is listed from
;;   the iSHARE Trusted List.
;;
;;   Certificates MUST be formatted as base64 encoded PEM.
;;
;;   The certificate of the client MUST be the first in the array, the
;;   root certificate MUST be the last.

;;   Except from the alg, typ and x5c parameter, the JWT header SHALL
;;   NOT contain other header parameters."

;; iSHARE JWT payload data specs
;;
;; From https://dev.ishareworks.org/reference/jwt.html#jwt-payload
;;
;;   "The JWT payload MUST conform to the private_key_jwt method as
;;    specified in OpenID Connect 1.0 Chapter 9.
;;
;;    The JWT MUST always contain the iat claim.
;;
;;    The iss and sub claims MUST contain the valid iSHARE
;;    identifier (EORI) of the client.
;;
;;    The aud claim MUST contain only the valid iSHARE identifier of
;;    the server. Including multiple audiences creates a risk of
;;    impersonation and is therefore not allowed.
;;
;;    The JWT MUST be set to expire in 30 seconds. The combination of
;;    iat and exp claims MUST reflect that. Both iat and exp MUST be
;;    in seconds, NOT milliseconds. See UTC Time formatting for
;;    requirements.
;;
;;    The JWT MUST contain the jti claim for audit trail purposes. The
;;    jti is not necessary a GUID/UUID.
;;
;;     Depending on the use of the JWT other JWT payload data MAY be
;;     defined."
